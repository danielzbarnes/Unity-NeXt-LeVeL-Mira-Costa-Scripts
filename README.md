# Unity Mira Costa Scripts
 Scripts used to control asset animations in Mira Costa's Marching Band and Colorguard's [NeXt LeVeL](https://youtu.be/wzpC7RIjIzM).

For this project I created the 3D environment in Unity in a Tron-esque style per the band director's vision.
I applied inverted UV maps to the Albedio and Emission Color on a plane and simple rock objects from the asset store to create a rocky valley.
The laser effects were created using volumetric lines from the asset store and animated using a play/pause cycle that were offset via scripts.
